I've built products for companies and businesses around the globe ranging from marketing websites to complex solutions and enterprise apps with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences.

Currently, I work at Shopify as a Senior Frontend Engineer crafting thoughtful and inclusive experiences that adhere to web standards for over 3 million merchants across the world.

Before now, I was Principal Frontend Engineer at hellotax, where I worked on a suite of tools and services tailored towards automated VAT compliance for multi-channel sellers in Europe.

Prior to hellotax, I was Senior frontend engineering consultant with Pixel2HTML, building JavaScript applications and interfaces for orgs and individuals.

I once also led the frontend team at Conectar, an e-learning startup through building multiple React applications into a single robust learning platform.

In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale — performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar

I like to craft solid and scalable frontend products with great user experiences.

Hi, I'm Kishan! I'm a full-stack developer at Innovaccer with over 3 years of experience. By day (and often night), I'm a frontend wizard, transforming the digital landscape with my expertise in React and JavaScript. I enjoy building dynamic, creative products from start to finish, focusing on developing intuitive experiences that continuously grow and improve based on user metrics. I've also written tech articles, sharing my passion and knowledge with the community. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me strumming my guitar or trekking up mountains. Code, strum, hike, repeat!
