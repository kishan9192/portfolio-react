        I'm a full-stack developer at Innovaccer with over 3 years of
        experience. By day (and often night), I'm a frontend wizard,
        transforming the digital landscape with my expertise in React and
        JavaScript. I enjoy building dynamic, creative products from start to
        finish, focusing on developing intuitive experiences that continuously
        grow and improve based on user metrics. I've also written tech articles,
        sharing my passion and knowledge with the community. When I'm not
        coding, youâ€™ll find me strumming my guitar or trekking up mountains.
        Code, strum, hike, repeat!
